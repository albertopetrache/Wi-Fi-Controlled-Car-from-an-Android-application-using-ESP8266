# Wi-Fi Controlled Car from an Android application using ESP8266

In this project I made a remote controlled car using the ESP8266 module. I used a
chassis with four DC motors, that I controlled using an ATMEL 8‐bit microcontroller
(ATmega1284). The car receives commands through the Android application such as:
forward, brake, backward, horn, left turn signal, right turn signal, hazard lights,
headlights, turn left, turn right and changing the speed by increasing or decreasing the
duty cycle of the PWM signal. The control of the four DC motors is achieved using a
H‐bridge converter (DRV8835). I also designed the printed circuit board (PCB) and
developed the Android application in Android Studio.
